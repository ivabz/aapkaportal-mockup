## AAP Ka Portal

A mockup for an integrated portal for Aam Aadmi Party (AAP)

> [See Mockup](http://rmehta.github.io/aapkaportal-mockup/index.html)

### Introduction

The AAP has got of to a spectacular debut and now has to scale up quickly. The portal is a solution that will bring all volunteers, issues and communication on one platform to enable participative democracy.

#### Inspiration

The design is loosely based on GitHub that provides an easy platform for volunteers to quickly develop open source software.

#### Language

My little bit of experience as a volunteer and member and interacting with other volunteers and people at jan sabhas was that the language of the people is not English, hence I was inspired to design this mockup grouds up in Hindi, so that I can capture the ethos of the organization and the Aam Aadmi in general.

This portal could very well be in English, Bengali, Malayalam or Marathi or any regional language. This has to be multi-lingual from the start.

On signing-up the user will be asked the language preference.

### Features

#### 1. Issues

The portal is built around "Issues" - these could be global ones like water or local ones like a narrow foot-over bridge at the railway station. All issues are can be children of a zone it could be national, state, district, ward or block.

- The portal will have clean urls to quickly reach issues: like `/maharashtra/south-central-mumbai/issues/water`
- Issues can have sub-issues that can be allocated to members
- There could be files attached to issues
- Wiki pages could be drafted if there are letters, RTI applications etc to be used for issues
- Voluteers can also dedicate them towards the issues
- There could also be milestones.

#### 2. Jan Sabha

The core architecture of the party is the Jan Sabha. This will ensure that the functioning of the party is always participative. All the happenings of a Jan Sabha and the outcomes should also be on the portal since if anyone wants ideas or reference it can be easily found. Knowledge sharing will also help scale up the party quickly.

- There will be a page for each Jan Sabha
- The outcomes will be clearly noted
- Follow-up tasks will be allocated
- Date of next Jan Sabha will also be announced
- Emails will be sent to all members in the region

#### 3. News

Internal news can be shared by any region / block on the portal. News module will have simple commenting structure

#### 4. Candidates and Nominees

Each candidate will be given a page and a model can be designed for standard fields.

The candidate can identify herself to issues, other members and also share vision via wikis and files

#### 5. Internal Lokpal

Since the party is founded on the concept of Lokpal and accountability, there should be an easy way for anyone to complaint if any member is misusing party name or mis-representing the party in any way. To scale up quickly, all kind of people will join. It is in the interest of maintaining quality that there should be easy access to this in the portal.

### Technology

This mockup is right now simple HTML / CSS based on Bootstrap and loosely insplired by GitHub.

My estimate is that our internal team can prepare a working prototype in one 3-4 day sprint.
